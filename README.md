ðŸš€ Expense Dashboard - AI/ML Powered Personal Finance Assistant ðŸ’¸
I am excited to share a project I've been working on â€” Expense Dashboard, an AI-driven personal finance assistant designed to help users manage their expenses more effectively. This project leverages the power of Machine Learning for predicting future spending trends and Django for the web framework, making it easy to track, analyze, and visualize expenses.
Key Features:
â€¢	Expense Tracking: The dashboard allows users to track their expenses in real-time, including details such as date, description, amount, and category.
â€¢	AI/ML Prediction: Based on historical expense data, the system predicts the user's spending for the next month, providing insights into future budget planning.
â€¢	Chart Visualization: A dynamic, interactive bar chart powered by Chart.js to visualize spending patterns for the current and predicted months.
â€¢	Responsive Design: The UI adapts seamlessly across all devices, offering a smooth and intuitive experience whether youâ€™re on desktop or mobile.
â€¢	Dark Mode: The dashboard includes a dark mode feature for better accessibility and user preference.
â€¢	Delete & Add Expense: Users can add new expenses and delete unwanted ones easily with a single click.
Tech Stack:
â€¢	Frontend:
o	HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
o	Chart.js for dynamic charting
o	Responsive Web Design ensuring seamless experience across devices
â€¢	Backend:
o	Django for the server-side logic and admin panel
o	MySQL database for secure and efficient data storage
o	Machine Learning (Python) for future expense prediction using regression models like Linear Regression.
â€¢	UI/UX:

o	Material Design principles for consistent and clean UI
Project Objectives:
â€¢	To empower individuals to understand their spending habits and predict future financial behavior using AI and ML.
â€¢	To provide an easy-to-use platform that integrates financial tracking with predictive analytics for more informed decision-making.
â€¢	To offer dynamic and visually appealing charts and a user-friendly interface that adapts to any screen size.
